# Drowsiness_Detection_System_for_Road_Safety
# Drowsiness Detection System for Road Safety using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system using computer vision techniques to detect driver drowsiness and alert them to prevent accidents caused by fatigue or sleepiness while driving. The system utilizes a camera to monitor the driver's facial features and analyze patterns to detect signs of drowsiness or distraction.

## Features
- Real-time detection of driver's drowsiness using computer vision.
- Facial landmark detection to track eye movements, facial expressions, and head poses.
- Sound or visual alerts triggered upon detecting signs of drowsiness or distraction.
- Configurable sensitivity levels for early detection of drowsiness.
- Easy integration with existing in-car systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Other necessary libraries (specified in requirements.txt)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/bikash2404/Drowsiness_Detection_System_for_Road_Safety.git

2. Install required libraries:
pip install scikit-learn
pip install imutils
pip install pygame
pip install dlib
pip install open_cv

3. Download necessary models or dependencies (if any) as specified in the documentation.

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
python drowsiness_detection.py

2. Adjust configuration settings as needed (sensitivity, alerts, etc.) by modifying the corresponding parameters in the script.

3. Ensure the camera is correctly positioned to capture the driver's face.

4. Monitor the output for drowsiness alerts or warnings displayed by the system.
